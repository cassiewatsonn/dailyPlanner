# dailyPlanner

## Description

This Daily Planner is for users looking to plan out their work day hour by hour. This project is built to create an opportunity for organization and time management while at work or at home. The main goal is to provide an easy efficient planner for everyone to use. 

As an aspriring web developer I want to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Installation

## Usage

When I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When I scroll down, then I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. When I view the timeblocks for that day, then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When I click into a timeblock then, I can enter an event. When I click the save button for that timeblock then, the text for that event is saved in local storage. When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist.
